Welcome to me GitHub profile!ðŸ˜ŠI'm a friendly, outgoing person who enjoys working in teams and giving my best in everything I do.

I graduated as an economist and I'm currently studying a Data Science Bootcamp to expand my skills in data analysis and visualization. I'm passionate about exploring patterns and trends in large datasets and applying my economic knowledge to projects related to economics and finance:bar_chart:

I like working in teams and collaborating with others to solve complex problems and achieve ambitious goalsðŸ‘¥. I consider myself a proactive, curious person who is always learning and looking to acquire new skills and apply them to challenging projects.

I'm excited to share my projects and collaborate with the GitHub community. Don't hesitate to contact me for any questions or collaborations!
